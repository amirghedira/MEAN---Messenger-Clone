# Overview

After getting advanced in MEAN stack development, I decided to take further by making a messenger clone that contains most of its functionalities 

 # Features

 As messenger, it provides instant messaging between users and seen message functionality. Also, it provides conversation customization from the colors, the emojis to pseudo names.

Not only that, sharing vocals photos and videos can be possible using a cloud service (Cloudinary) to save those files.

Besides, vocal calls and video calls are part of this application using `WebRTC` and `WebSockets`.
Without forgetting deleting conversations, and deleting messages with an instant update, archiving conversations, and blocking users.
The result was pretty amazing.
